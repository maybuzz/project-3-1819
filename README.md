## Concept
Add a new feature to the existing "Kandidaatvinden" chat for Lifely. I want to give the candidate more responsibility by letting them fill in the form.   

## Conclusion
I've learned a lot about working with socket.io. A few weeks ago I had no clue how to work with sockets, but this week I finally got the hang of it.

Due to lack of time (and focussing on the socket.io) I haven't implemented keyevents of any of the exclusive design principles.
