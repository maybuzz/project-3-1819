## Concept
Add a new feature to the existing "Kandidaatvinden" chat for Lifely. I want to give the candidate more responsibility by letting them fill in the form. For this project I added the new feature to the intermediair side of the chat. The intermediair can `send` pieces of the form to the client. The client can fill them in in the chat. The answers will appear in the form. 

Initially I wanted to create a client (candidate) side chat, so I could work out the feature on this side too. Here clients can `request` pieces of the form so they don't have to wait for the intermediair to respond or send something.  

## Conclusion
I've learned a lot about working with socket.io. A few weeks ago I had no clue how to work with sockets, but this week I finally got the hang of it.

Due to lack of time (and focussing on the socket.io) I haven't implemented keyevents of any of the exclusive design principles.
